# MovieRecommenderSystem


Personality Diagnosis is used to recommend the Movies to the users. It is a colloborative Filtering method based on bayesian approach. Refer the recommender.system.using.machine.learning.pdf  for more details.

The other forked repository of Recommender system(from manu) uses various other approaches (except for the one implemented here).

IMDb publically available dataset is used. The system only implements user based collobartive filtering and NO concept for the collaborating items on the content based is used.  

The code is implemented in PersonalityDiagnosis.py and direct derived mathematical equations from recommender.system.using.machine.learning.pdf  are used
