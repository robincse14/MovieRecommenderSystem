{"reviewerID": "AD5MZA8SOVMPJ", "asin": "B000GIOPK2", "reviewerName": "Brandon Nolta", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "People who like cartoons must be thankful for DVDs, because that technology opened up the floodgates for fans for every kind of animation. Whether you like classic Looney Tunes, hippy-dippy sci-fi parables or Asian tentacle porn, it's all there for you to find and enjoy. It's only been in the last 20 years or so, however, that American TV networks have clued into the idea that many adults like cartoons that have content specifically aimed at adults, even though some cartoons did well in prime-time even fifty years ago or so. Now, with DVD, you can not only watch entire seasons at a shot, you can also see the shows in their unadulterated glory.Which brings us to the Comedy Central series Drawn Together. I've been a fan of this show for a while, partly because of the writing and partly because of the cheerful way in which it steamrolls political correctness and good taste. If South Park is the Mount Everest of crude, crass animation, then Drawn Together is K2; it doesn't stand as tall, but it's a tougher climb. The truth of this was brought home upon watching the second season of the show on DVD. Much to my surprise, watching the DVD turned out to be a different experience than watching it in first run.Part of this is due to one of the DVD set's selling points: it's unexpurgated. I didn't think this would make much of a difference, as it's generally pretty clear what's been cut. As it turns out, there was a lot cut out of the show, and not just language: genitalia, violence, enough racist abuse to make the KKK turn red under their sheets, sex in a vast array of configurations and a whole lot of other content that probably produces instant pucker in the unfortunate souls who work in Comedy Central's Standards and Practices department. Now, I'm not one for censorship, but the additional material works against the show to a certain degree. What's there is still funny in multiple senses, from satire to slapstick, but actually being able to hit the money words (and shots) dilutes the humor a bit.As far as taste goes, DT is not a show to start novices on. If adult animation is still a new concept for you, and you think The Simpsons is bleeding-edge in the sometimes fluid space between being socially acceptable and being a pariah, then DT may cause seizures. For people who like edgy animation, this will be just the ticket. The voiceover artists and writers take their material seriously, and they're willing to go wherever the jokes take them (the season finale has a running gag with historical dates and the episodes connected to them that manages to be both subtle and sick).In terms of presentation, the DT set is relatively bare-bones. The whole season of 15 episodes is crammed onto two discs, leaving just enough room for a handful of interviews with the voiceover artists (minus Adam Carolla, who has plenty to do outside the show) and a karaoke singalong. The visual quality is pretty sharp, and the sound quality is good, but this isn't the kind of material you use to do any THX certifications with, so it's not like you'd expect much. Still, it's the episodes that matter, and for you sick little monkeys out there who like this kind of thing, Drawn Together season 2 is a worthwhile expenditure. Just don't leave it out where Grandma or the kids might get a hold of it. Either you'll scar them for life (maybe shuffling Granny into an early grave), or you'll never get it back.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Funny, vulgar and sick: three of my favorite things...", "unixReviewTime": 1218240000, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2008"}

Moreover, some wanted to know if there were any extras in the dvds such has interviews, deleted scenes or bloopers and there is none (sorry), only the episodes. However, now, for the appreciation part of the serie, I would definetly recommend South of Nowhere to teenagers who like romantic/drama series. Even though your not gay, you can fully appreciate this tv show for its originality, its funny parts and its themes such has love, teenage \"problems\" (first time, moving in a new city, fitting in, the need to belong somewere, ennemies, etc.). And for the girls that are gay, well, you will appreciate this story because of all the reasons above and because it shows, trough Spencer's story, all the steps that someone goes trough when they gradually find out their true sexuality and how they live their first real love. Furthermore, I have to say this, Ashley (Mandy Musgrave)and Spencer (Gabrielle Christian)are really gorgeous and they form a beautiful couple.

I had read some bad things about this set but I bought it anyway, I was a big fan of the show back then and I just wanted to be able to watch it again. I wanted to buy all 3 seasons but that would have been pretty expensive. lol I do plan to buy the other two later. But as some have already stated, the theme music is different. I didn't like it at first but after you watch it all the way through you don't mind the theme music, it's just strange to me that they changed it...? this is a great gift for anyone you may know struggling with their sexuality. it got me through some tough times with my own when it was on television and now I can sit back and watch Spencer's plight knowing what she's gone through already firsthand. The set is only 3 DVDs long it's a very short season, that's why it's so cheap compared to season 2 & 3 but I recommend it to anyone. I really wish everyone would watch the whole season I think it would change some views of a lot of closed-minded people. All three seasons of the show depict a young girl struggling to balance between making her mother, a religious woman with strong opinions, happy and letting herself be who she is finding out she is. Her father, a guidance counselor of sorts, just wants her to be happy but he's got his own problems. The story also centers on her two brothers, one adopted and looking for his birth mother, and one blood brother who is trying to be a basketball star and runs into complications along the way. Ashley and Spencer are adorable together and this is, above all, a love story for the next generation. The set itself is no fuss no muss, comes with just the box and 3 DVDs, conservatively decorated, but it's what is inside that counts, which is hours of enjoyment that will make you go \"awww!\" and have you smiling to yourself. I would give this whole series as a gift to anyone and everyone if it weren't so expensive I think everyone should watch it it's both entertaining and helpful in understanding the plight of lesbian and bisexual people. Ashley never says she's a lesbian (that I remember. at least not in this season) and sometimes she plays around with aiden but in the end we know she's not into men. Spencer is \"not into labels\" and I love her for that so we never know whether to classify either of them as \"bi\" or \"gay\" as spencer called it, but I can pretty safely say  this is a show about girls, for girls, of any orientation. It's compelling and full of sweet moments anyone could enjoy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "South Of Nowhere Season 1", "unixReviewTime": 1290470400, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2010"}

Because I know if I had not already learned one or two songs from these artists, along with some basic fretboard theory, I wouldn't know where to begin with this $14 purchase.Or just don't buy this video.

I've poured concrete professionally for 15 years and I thought it would be interesting to watch someone else's technique. I feel that a sidewalk could be a do-it-yourself type of job, IF you have the motivation. but if you plan on pouring a 16 x 22' drive way (especially in the summer) you MUST have someone helping you who knows about concrete. the air temperature, humidity, slump and wind all have a strong bearing on how the concrete will dry. Ready mix yards may suggest a retarder for adverse drying conditions but you really do need to know what you are doing. The timing of when to start finishing the concrete is never the same twice, so maybe the 10 min. limit he suggested is ok or maybe not. If you fresno the surface before it's ready and the bleed water can come up you will seal it and this can result in blistering, peeling and dusting of the surface which will greatly reduce the life of your concrete. I would suggest reading the ACI (ASCC1). You only get 1 shot to do it right and concrete is hard within 90 minutes of leaving the mix plant so be careful.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good luck!", "unixReviewTime": 1365465600, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2013"}

Americans will also be interested in seeing the significant differences in policing and the widespread use of closeed-circuit TV cameras in public places that oftentimes provides crucial evidence or clues.
